 * the onscreen windows, and then controlling the timing of the animation so that you can 
 * achieve consistent performance on different devices.

		* 3) Forces a repaint of the program, thus displaying the updated values/positions of Shippy
		* 4) Calculates an appropriate amount of time to pause before running the loop again. This
